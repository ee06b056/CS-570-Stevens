I recently bought a pair of sneakers online after some browsing. I knew exactly what I was getting, having owned the same model and size before; they just weren’t available in any neighborhood stores. The sneakers arrived in a few days, and I was satisfied with them.
Over the next week I was hounded by online ads for the same sneakers I’d bought, along with others I’d rejected and many more I hadn’t even seen. (Amazon also showcased items “inspired by” my browsing history.) I tried to ignore them, but after seeing so many ghosts of sneakers past and passed up, I began second-guessing my purchase.
